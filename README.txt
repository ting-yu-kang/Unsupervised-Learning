My codes, datasets, and training results are available at https://github.com/ting-yu-kang/Unsupervised-Learning.git

File Descriptions:
    1. Source Code/:
       part1.py to part5.py correspond to the five parts of the report.
    2. Datasets/:
        The dataset is attached for reference. But in the code, I fetch the datasets through urls instead.

Execution:
    1. To execute the codes, please go the the Google Colaboratory(https://colab.research.google.com/).
    2. Create a new Python3 notebook.
    3. Paste the code on the pad.
    4. Press the run bottom on the upper left.
